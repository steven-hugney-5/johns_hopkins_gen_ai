# John's Hopkins Certificate in Generative AI
This repo is for the John's Hopkins Certificate in Applied Generative AI. I orignally made this for myself, but I see it as an oportunity for other classmates to use git and get used to working collaboratively on a repo.
 as we go through the class, commit & push, and make PRs.


### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/johns_hopkins_gen_ai.git
    cd johns_hopkins_gen_ai
    ```

2. **Create and Switch to a New Branch**  
    Create a branch with your name or an alias to keep your changes organized:  
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

3. **Add Your Folder**  
    Create a folder with your name or alias inside the repository directory. Add any files or code you want to contribute.

4. **Stage and Commit Your Changes**  
    Stage your changes and commit them with a meaningful message:  
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add my folder and initial files"
    ```

5. **Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository**  
    Push your branch to the remote repository to make your changes available for review:  
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
    Go to the repository on GitHub, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab, and click "New Pull Request." Select your branch and submit the PR for review.

7. **Keep Your Branch Updated**  
    Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your branch up to date:  
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout your-branch-name
    git merge main
    ```

8. **Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Any)**  
    If there are conflicts during the merge, resolve them in your code editor, then stage and commit the resolved files:  
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
    ```

9. **Repeat the Workflow**  
    Continue to make changes, commit, push, and create PRs as needed throughout the course.

### Additional Tips
- Use descriptive commit messages to make your changes clear to others.
- Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting new work.
- Ask for help if you're unsure about any stepâ€”collaboration is key!
